I was initially wanting to just modify the files itself. This would not be good if there are multiple files in your project and it creates a .cover file for each file in your project that ran through the test. So I was thinking of creating an output file which runs through the cover files. It'll have a different file type like .subtest. after running through each test case I would compile the subtests into a single file which contains all of the +/-. \r\n\r\nIf you guys have any other ideas I'm open for suggestions.
