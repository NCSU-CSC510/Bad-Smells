# Project 2 Report - Quest for Bad Smells
###Projects we took for analysis :
1. CMS-module
2. MarkParser
3. Tarantula-python

##Data Collection

TO ADD : 
1. How data was collected
2. Issue Data Collection
3. Label Data Collection
4. Commit Data Collection
5. Milestone Data Collection

##Anonymization
To anonymize the data, we numbered each project as Project1, Project2 and Project3 and also numbered the users in a project as person1, person2 etc.

##Tables


##Data

##Data Samples
**1. Commit distribution**

**2. Commits percentage of each user**

**3. Issues skipped**

**4. Label distribution**

**5. Label-Unlabled time**

**6. Milestone exceeded time**

##Feature Detection

**1. Commit distribution**

In this feature, we wanted to analyze the commit frequency on a week by week basis. Our aim was to determine the variation in the commit frequency.

**2. Commits percentage of each user**

In this feature, we wanted to compare the percentage of commits by each user in the project. We wanted to determine that there are no "passengers"(users with less than 10% of the total commits) and there are no "great dictators"(user with more than 75% of the total commits).

**3. Issues skipped**

**4. Label distribution**

In this feature we wanted to get the distribution of the issues across different labels. We wanted to determine that there are no label tags with most of the issues whereas other labels with no or very few issues.

**5. Label-Unlabled time**

**6. Milestone exceeded time**

In this feature we wanted to get the data for milestones and how many milestones completed on time and how many milestone exceeded the expected completion time.
