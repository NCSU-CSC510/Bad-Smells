# Project 2 Report - Quest for Bad Smells
###Projects we took for analysis :
1. CMS-module
2. MarkParser
3. Tarantula-python

##Data Collection

TO ADD : 
1. How data was collected
2. Issue Data Collection
3. Label Data Collection
4. Commit Data Collection
5. Milestone Data Collection

##Anonymization
To anonymize the data, we numbered each project as P1, P2 and P3 and also numbered the users in a project as user1, user2, user3 etc. Withing each project to analyze the various labels, we have named the labels as L1,L2,L3 etc.

##Tables
After the data collection phase, we have stored the data in a excel spreadsheet. The data for each project was anonymized based on the above mentioned scheme. Also, the data was separated based on the features as presented below. After categorizing the data into different features, we calculated the mean and the statndard deviation for each project per feature. The data was analyzed and all the values which differ the mean by 1.5 times the standard deviation were marked. After analyzing the data, we have plotted graphs for each feature.

##Data Samples
**1. Commit Distribution**

**2. No passenger**

**3. No great dictator**

**4. Assignment of issues**

**5. Issues skipped**

**6. No overused label**

**7. Redundant/useless labels**

**8. Too much time spent on a label**

**9. Very less times spent on a label**

**10. Milestones overdue**

**11. Milestone issues**

##Feature Detection and Results
**1. Commit Distribution**
In this feature we analyzed the commit data for each project on a week basis. The idea was to determine the commit ditribution over the project timelines. 
***Results :***

**2. No passenger**
The idea behind this feature was to analyze the commit percentage of each user so that there are no passengers who have very less number of commits 
Results :

**3. No great dictator**
The idea behind this feature was to determine the commit distribution of each user so that there are no great dictators(one person with most of the commits).
Results :

**4. Assignment of issues**
In this feature we wanted to check how many issues are assigned and how many issues are closed without any assignee.
Results :

**5. Issues skipped**
In this feature we wanted to check the expected completion time and the actual completion time of each issue.
Results :

**6.Overused label**
In this feature we wanted to analyze the 

**7. Unused labels**
In this feature we have analzed the time spent by each issue in a particulart label and check if this time was too short so that there this label was redundant or useless.
Results :

**8. Too much time spent on a label**

**9. Very less times spent on a label**

**10. Milestones overdue**

**11. Milestone issues**
