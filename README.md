# Project 2 Report - Quest for Bad Smells
###Projects we took for analysis :
1. CMS-module
2. MarkParser
3. Tarantula-python

##Data Collection

TO ADD : 
1. How data was collected
2. Issue Data Collection
3. Label Data Collection
4. Commit Data Collection
5. Milestone Data Collection

##Anonymization
To anonymize the data, we numbered each project as P1, P2 and P3 and also numbered the users in a project as user1, user2, user3 etc. Withing each project to analyze the various labels, we have named the labels as L1,L2,L3 etc.

##Tables
After the data collection phase, we have stored the data in a excel spreadsheet. The data for each project was anonymized based on the above mentioned scheme. Also, the data was separated based on the features as presented below. After categorizing the data into different features, we calculated the mean and the statndard deviation for each project per feature. The data was analyzed and all the values which differ the mean by 1.5 times the standard deviation were marked. After analyzing the data, we have plotted graphs for each feature.
